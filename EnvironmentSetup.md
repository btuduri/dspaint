This page details how to setup a development environment for compiling the source code.

  1. Download DevKitPro by following the guide [here](http://www.coderjoe.net/archive/2007/07/10/so-you-want-to-make-nintendo-ds-homebrew/). Be sure to set everything up in your home folder rather than /usr as the guide suggests.
  1. Be sure to add the necessary export lines to _~/.bashrc_.
  1. Open the project in your chosen IDE.
  1. Compile using the makefile provided.
  1. You can debug/test the binary without a DS by using an emulator. A decent emulator that is Windows only but works perfectly via wine is [No$GBA](http://nocash.emubase.de/no\$gba-w.zip).
