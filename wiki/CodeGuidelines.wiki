= Introduction =

This page tells you how we like out code to be done.

= Source Files =

  * Source files and folder names are in lowercase.
  * Source files either have the extension .cpp/.h depending on whether they are source/header files.

= Constants =

  * Constants will always be in BLOCK CAPS with underscores for spaces.
  * They are always prefixed with an identifier followed by an underscore.
  * Constants relating to the DS will are prefixed with DS.
  * Constants relating to DS Paint will are prefixed with DSP.

= Methods =

  * Methods should have a comment block above describing the purpose of the method, parameters and return type. Exceptions that can be thrown should also be listed.

= Syntax =

  * Curly brackets for code blocks should be on their own line, like this:
  {{{
  Foo()
  {
    bar();
  }
  }}}
  * Single-line code blocks should either use curly brackets, like this:
  {{{
  if (foo == 0)
  {
    bar = 1;
  }
  }}}
  ... or be on the same line, like this:
  {{{
  if (foo == 0) bar = 1;
  }}}
  * Methods which take more than 3 parameters should use a seperate line for each parameter, like this:
  {{{
  void Foo()
  {
    method(
      parameter1,
      parameter2,
      parameter3,
      parameter4,
    );
  }
  }}}
