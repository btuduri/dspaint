  # Download DevKitPro by following the guide [http://www.coderjoe.net/archive/2007/07/10/so-you-want-to-make-nintendo-ds-homebrew/ here]. Be sure to set everything up in your home folder rather than /usr as the guide suggests.
  # Be sure to add the necessary export lines to _~/.bashrc_.
  # Open the project in your chosen IDE.
  # Compile using the makefile provided.
